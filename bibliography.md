## Bibliography

Each of us is a bit like an Large Language Model (LLM, such as ChatGPT), absorbing information from countless sources and regurgitating it with our modifications and hallucinations. This bibliography lists some media that has influenced me and that I recommend to others.

I list these in no particular order.

- [In Search of the Miraculous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_the_Miraculous])
- **The Five Sons of King Pandu**
- **The Baghavad Gita As It Is**

### Entertainment

#### Books

- The Shining, Stephen King - I saw the movie directed by Stanley Kubrik first, but the book is as good or better.
- The Bachman Books, Stephen King - For some reason my dad gave this to me when I was a teenager.

#### Music
