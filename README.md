# jpw3: The Book of My Life

## Introduction

This project intends to be a book about my life, although it's more of a collection of essays, scraps, lists, and other resources than an actual book, and I don't expect to ever complete any of it. 

Other than possibly to find typos and other minor errors to correct, I do not intend to use so-called "Artificial Intelligence" in the creation of this work. These are my words, typed by my hands. Specifically, I'm using LibreOffice Writer, VSCodium, git, and github with Fedora Linux running on a Lenovo Laptop, most frequently with an external keyboard, monitor, and mouse.

I write this primarily for my children, but not talking to them directly. I chose to write my life story because it seems to be the only thing that I can do that someone else would be unable to do, as each of us lives a different life. I believe that my experience has been distinctly unique. While I have experienced significant trauma, my life has also included some entertaining stories that may provide some guidance so that others can avoid mistakes like those that I have made.

Unfortunately, each of us needs to make our own mistakes and learn our own lessons. Because what we call common sense is based on walking our individual paths, there really is no such thing as common sense. Maybe in writing this, readers may be able to absorb some of what I consider to be my common sense, and hopefully benefit as a result.
