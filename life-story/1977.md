## The First Pivotal Year - 1977

At the end of April in 1977, I turned four years old. I think that one of my first memories is of my birthday party. My mom, who I think never had to work for money, did crafts. She apparently put some work into either a "Cowboys and Indians" or pure Native American theme for this party. 

I think that my next memory is either the night of the accident in October or a subsequent date, possibly the day that my mother died. My parents had gone to a party, so I assume at least my dad had had too much to drink. My mom was giving the babysitter a ride home when a drunk driver in a van with its lights off T-bioned her tiny economy car. I heard that they found her in a field and the babysitter had a broken leg.

The memory is of my dad telling us three boys. In my mind's picture, he's sitting or nealing near us or on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed with us. Terry built that bed, which stayed in my family for about another decade. Terry was a business partner in carpentry with Carl, who was Andy's dad.

I don't remember any words, just my father's grimness. Supposedly, Adrian apparently didn't understand or didn't believe it and started laughing. 

Another story from this period is that the adults asked Tim if he wanted us to go see her in the hospital. This seems like a ridiculous responsibility to put on a child only six years in age. Tim declined, which I believe was probably the right decision. He's always felt guilty about this, but I guess I would rather remember my mother as a perfect angel than basically a mutilated corpse on a hospital bed.

She lived for about nine days, but there was never any chance of survival, which probably wouldn't have been for the best anyway. She died in a helicopter on the way to have her eyes donated to another medical patient.

I remember we wrote notes to mom, tied them to baloons, and release the baloons. I have no idea what I wrote, but I was certain that it would not reach mom. I grew up pretty quickly from this point, realizing that I had to put on appearances for other people, and especially to look strong for my father, who was obviously overhelmed with three children. Adrian was somewhat difficult at this age, and Tim has always been difficult.

I don't remember the exact order of events, but around this time, I was in a Monetssori school, which I absolutely loved. I may have been enrolled before the accident, or I may have been enrolled because Anne didn't think I should think too much about what had happened. I was only in this program for a couple of few weeks at most. Supposedly, Anne also thought that it would be best for me to be near her, so my dad moved me to the kindergarden at the grouper school named Great Oak. Anne was the teacher. So I entered kindergarden a year early, the youngest child in the class, a late entry, and the only child without a mother. 

I don't remember much of kindergarden. I remember a really scary doberman that was chained up near the classroom at the property on Sonoma Mountain. I remember Anne gave me something like a porcelain gardenia on a rock, as this had been my mother's favorite flower. I felt bad when the petals eventually broke and I had to throw it away, but who gives a child something so delicate? I remember that a kid named Toby with very thick glasses bit me for no apparent reason. He came from a somewhat troubled home and ended up being the victim of everyone in my grade.

I have a vague memory of going to court, but I don't remember if I testified. I think my dad won a civil suit, and I seem to remember that my family received about $200,000, which would have been quite a bit of money at the time. It's possible that we didn't receive anything, and other than things like housing, food, and private schooling, I never received anything directly from this. My dad made bad investments and spent almost everything before he eventually passed away.

I think we got rid of Beatle. I don't know when, but some time later, we got a mut that looked like it was mostly Collie from some children that had puppies in a cardboard box in front of a grocery store. We named him Duncan.
