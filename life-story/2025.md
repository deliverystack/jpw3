## 2025 - Maybe the Craziest Year?




### Motorbike Accident

In Laos, I ride a Honda Wave 100, generally with a helmet and flip flops but no other gear, like most riders. Speeds are generally slow and wearing and carrying protective equipment is really hot. Because it has manual gearing and foot pegs on the sides, I would call it a 100cc motorbike rather than a scooter, meaning that it has a relatively small engine. I think my top speed is probably about 60km/hr. I gave Kham money to buy this bike shortly after we met in 2018, so it's about seven years old. Lately, it's felt pretty rickety, specifically the wheels, which often need new tubes. 

I recently purchased a new helmet of better quality than my previous helmet, and with a clear visor as opposed to a sun shade, although I think it has minor darkening. 

On Friday, 17 October, a woman came to my house in Laos looking for Kham, who was in the outdoor kitchen and didn't hear her calls. She left a birthday party invitation card. At first I thought that this was a nice custom, but on opening the card I found QR codes for making financial contributions. This is not unreasonable (almost everyone here is poor), but it was unexpected.

I've been to a large number of Lao parties. They're generally always the same - various Lao foods with everyone drinking beer until they develop the courage to dance to the music. I didn't want to go to the party and especially didn't want to drink. The music generally sucks, I don't know anyone, Kham and the children abandon me, the people don't speak English, I don't like most of the food, it's always too hot, and I stand out for being the sweating white guy there alone for no apparent reason.

Instead, I wanted to go to a nice falang restaraunt, most likely Ai Capone's (great pizza but I generally order the beef ravioli - trying to do what I can for my health). I probably would have had a caraffe of wine and a salad while eating slowly and reading a book alone. Then I would have gone to the bars, though I planned not to drink alcohol (I now pay for soda water); I just wanted some conversation in English and to dance.

We compromised, meaning that I went to the party, Kham wanted the family to go together in the car. I knew from past experiences that this would trap me at the party for hours, until she decided to leave. So I followed her on the motorbike. She said that I could leave after finishing one beer.

At first, the party was very uncomfortable for me. I was the only white person there, the music was incredibly loud and annoying, there was no food that I wanted to eat (despite people pushing things towards me, which I either have to eat or rudely decline), and I was sweating like a horse. With the woman sitting next to me, I was able to have the same limitted conversation in broken English that I've had dozens of times at such events, discussing where I'm from, what I think of Lao, their relationship with the USA, and so forth.

I drank my beer (a large Beer Lao). One good thing in this context is that in Laos, beer is often served with ice, which means I also drank some water. I had a couple of pieces of beef and part of an egg pancake, but nothing like a meal. 

At some point, another woman showed up at the table. I've net her before - Kham took me to her house because she wanted to buy it. This woman actually seems pretty cool, like she has worked internationally in the entertainment industry. Her English is not as limitted as most. She and I danced a few times (Kham says she prefers to watch rather than dance), which was actually enjoyable. A couple of other white people showed up but there were no introductions. 

Over these few hours, Kham encouraged me to drink two more large beers. Someone came buy with a galon jug of home-made rice whiskey, which is often dangerous for me. Even with water and food, this would generally be enough to get me at least tipsy, if not drunk, especially on an empty stomach, and particularly because my tolerance is down from not drinking much lately. 

After a few dances, I decided that it was time for me to go. I got the motorbike out of the mud patch where I had parked it and down the loose gravel driveway. I didn't have any problems getting to the bars; I actually felt pretty sober (feeling and breathing the fresh wind on a ride can help with that). My man Mark that runs the Yankee bar that generally has the most interesting English speakers was away caring for his child, there was no weed for sale, and there did not appear to be any interesting customers, so I went to a nearby bar where the female owner seems to really like me.

I think I had two soda waters, but she broke out the whiskey, and I think I had a shot or two. Once I start drinking, I have a bad habit of continuing until it's too late.

After that, I went to Wind West, which I consider to be the best music club in Vientiane, though it starts relatively late and seems to feature the same musicians every Friday and Saturday night. I don't remember ordering water, but I don't think I had more than two small Beer Laos, and I was there for quite some time.

The woman who had been at the party showed up and we danced together a bit, but I also danced with the woman who owned the other bar, and probably a few other people. My memory is hazy even when I don't drink.

What I didn't do was eat or sleep. It was getting late and I decided to head home. I seemed fine on the motorbike.















 Usually, they drink Beer Lao, but
