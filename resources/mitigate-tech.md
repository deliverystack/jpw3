Humans may be more likely to take an action when they feel unhappy than when they feel happy. In fact, happiness may not be a natural state. From an evolutionary perspective, an animal is more likely to be eaten by another when it is happily enjoying its life than when it is unhappily taking precautions to ensure its survival.

Marketers use this fact to manipulate people, specifically towards purchasing products and services. In other words, marketing (including social media) is designed to make you unhappy. The more you use technology such as social media and even artificial intelligence, the less happy you are likely to be.

Marketers study human psychology and its weaknesses such as greed and anxiety. They use a variety of techniques to make you unhappy. 

Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): One tactic used by marketers is to cause audiences to feel that they are less than others if they do not immediately

Marketers employ a variety of psychological tactics to influence human emotions and behavior, often leveraging cognitive biases, emotional triggers, and social dynamics. These tactics are designed to guide consumers toward making purchases or taking specific actions. Here are some of the most common strategies:

1. Scarcity and Urgency

Psychological Principle: People are more motivated to act when they perceive something as scarce or in limited supply.

How it's used:

Limited-time offers or limited availability (e.g., "Only 5 left in stock" or "Sale ends in 24 hours").

These create a sense of urgency, prompting consumers to act quickly out of fear of missing out (FOMO). This taps into loss aversion, a well-documented psychological tendency where people fear losing out on opportunities more than they enjoy gaining them.

2. Social Proof

Psychological Principle: Humans are social creatures and tend to follow the actions or opinions of others, especially in uncertain situations.

How it's used:

Customer reviews and testimonials: Seeing that others have had positive experiences can influence potential buyers.

Celebrity endorsements or influencers promoting products, which leverage the credibility and trust associated with these figures.

User-generated content on social media also encourages others to engage with the brand.

3. Reciprocity

Psychological Principle: When someone does something for us, we feel a natural obligation to return the favor.

How it's used:

Free samples, trials, or gifts: Companies give away something for free, which can prompt consumers to reciprocate by purchasing the product or service.

"Free shipping" offers or discounts: These create a feeling of indebtedness, subtly influencing consumers to make a purchase.

4. Anchoring

Psychological Principle: People tend to rely on the first piece of information (anchor) when making decisions, even if that information is irrelevant.

How it's used:

Price anchoring: For example, a product might be priced at $100, but a “sale” shows the original price as $150, making the $100 price seem like a better deal.

Marketers use this principle by showing a higher original price to make the current price seem like a bargain.

5. Emotional Appeal

Psychological Principle: People often make decisions based on emotions rather than logic, especially when the emotions align with their desires or self-image.

How it's used:

Heartwarming advertisements that evoke feelings of happiness, nostalgia, or empathy (think of ads that feature family, pets, or emotional life moments).

Fear-based marketing (e.g., insurance ads or public service announcements) that make people fear negative outcomes, prompting them to take action to avoid that fear.

Aspirational branding: Positioning a product or service as something that will make the consumer feel better about themselves (e.g., luxury goods or fitness brands that associate their products with health, success, or status).

6. Framing

Psychological Principle: How information is presented (framed) can significantly affect decision-making.

How it's used:

Positive framing: “90% fat-free” versus “Contains 10% fat” (both technically the same, but one sounds more appealing).

Loss framing: Highlighting what you might lose rather than gain, such as “Don’t miss out on this limited offer” or “Only 1 day left to save.”

Marketers can frame a message in a way that emphasizes potential gains or minimizes perceived losses to influence consumer decisions.

7. Commitment and Consistency

Psychological Principle: Once someone makes a commitment, they are more likely to act consistently with that commitment, especially if it’s public or voluntary.

How it's used:

Small, initial commitments: For example, asking a consumer to sign up for a free trial or newsletter can make them more likely to make a purchase later.

Public commitments: Companies might encourage customers to post their experiences or reviews online, creating social pressure to follow through on their purchase behavior.

8. The Mere Exposure Effect

Psychological Principle: People tend to develop a preference for things just because they are familiar with them.

How it's used:

Repeated exposure to a brand: The more times a consumer is exposed to a brand (through ads, social media, or other media), the more they are likely to trust and purchase from that brand, even without actively thinking about it.

Consistent brand imagery and jingles that consumers hear over and over again, creating a sense of familiarity and trust.

9. Cognitive Dissonance

Psychological Principle: People experience discomfort (dissonance) when their beliefs or behaviors are inconsistent, and they are motivated to reduce this discomfort.

How it's used:

Post-purchase rationalization: After purchasing, marketers will often emphasize how great the purchase was, using emails or advertisements that reinforce the decision, ensuring that the consumer doesn’t regret it.

Reassurance: Warranties, money-back guarantees, and customer service policies that minimize the perceived risk of making a purchase.

10. Nostalgia Marketing

Psychological Principle: People often feel a strong emotional attachment to memories from their past, especially from childhood or significant life moments.

How it's used:

Ads or products that reference the past, such as retro packaging or using music from a certain era, evoke positive feelings of nostalgia.

Brands might incorporate elements that remind consumers of their younger years, appealing to emotions like warmth, happiness, and comfort.

11. Color Psychology

Psychological Principle: Colors evoke emotional responses and can influence perceptions of a product or brand.

How it's used:

Red for urgency or excitement (e.g., clearance sales or fast food).

Blue for trust and reliability (e.g., banking and tech companies).

Green for health and sustainability (e.g., organic or eco-friendly brands).

Marketers strategically choose colors for logos, packaging, and advertising to evoke specific emotions that align with their brand values.

12. Priming

Psychological Principle: Exposure to certain stimuli influences how we respond to subsequent, related stimuli.

How it's used:

Subtle cues in ads, such as images of happy families or luxury items, can prime consumers to associate the brand with success, comfort, or luxury.

Marketers use priming in the form of slogans, background music, or even the arrangement of items on a webpage to subtly nudge a person toward a desired behavior, like clicking "buy now" or adding an item to their cart.

13. Appealing to Self-Image

Psychological Principle: People want to see themselves in a positive light and will make purchases that reinforce their self-image or identity.

How it's used:

Lifestyle marketing that positions a product as an essential part of a desirable lifestyle (e.g., fitness brands promoting a healthy, active lifestyle or high-end brands selling an image of sophistication and success).

Personalization: Offering products that can be tailored to the individual’s specific preferences or tastes (e.g., custom shoes, personalized skincare).

These tactics are often used in combination to create a more powerful effect. The key to successful marketing lies in understanding the psychological triggers that lead to certain behaviors and leveraging them in a way that feels natural and appealing to the target audience.
