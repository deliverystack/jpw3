## Things To Do Daily

In no particular order, I recommend doing as many of the following things as possible every day.

- Appreciation exercises, breathing exercises, meditation, prayer, and/or positive affirmations. These can be done together and while doing other things, such as washing the dishes.
- Stretech, yoga, qi gong, or something similar.
- Make your bed.
- Brush your teeth, at least twice.
- Floss, at least once, preferably using a waterpick.
- Exercise.
- Straighten up your entire home.
- Genuinely recommit, restate your commitment, and say at least or do at least five nice things for any life partner. For example, make coffee, provide a genuince compliment, ask if there is anything that you can do for them, ask what they might want for dinner, ask how they are feeling, and remind them that you love and care about them.
- Clean one room of your home.
- Read, for example from a spiritual text or something about psychology.
- Write, especially journaling.
- Communicate with at least one other person with whom you don't otherwise interact frequently.
- Purge, including both possessions and data, such as old files and email.
- Plan and prepare, whether for today or tomorrow. Determine your top priorities and do things like selecting your clothes. Any tasks you do earlier will improve your experiences later.

### Things **NOT** To Do Daily

In no particular order, I recommend not doing the following things every day. These things are better in moderation.

- Eat unhealthy food.
- Drink alcohol.
- Intake caffeine.
- Smoke anything.
- Do any other drugs.
- Sexual activity of any kind.
- Intake caffeine.
- Use the Internet too much. Actually, this is something that you should never do. Set a limit and stay within that limit. Take some days completely off from the Internet (to the extent possible).
