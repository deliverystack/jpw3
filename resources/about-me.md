I know it’s a hodgepodge of unrelated content, but this deliverystack.net seems to be my primary blog these days, as I don’t really use CMS anymore, don’t have sufficient time or expertise to blog about Rust, and will leave Windows/WSL for Linux this year. Honestly, I hope to blog most about the Orchex Enterprise Orchestration Engine, but I get distracted.

Anyway, if you like any of the content here, you might want to check some other things I’ve published historically:

I do *not* recommend that you read my ancient book, which was rushed through a publishing process with marketing, content, and structural requirements not under my control:

Fortunately, my 10,000+ posts to the Interwoven and Sitecore developer networks have gone down the memory hole. Unfortunately, so has the meme that once circulated about my excessive blogging. Those were hilarious; thank you, dear readers. In truth, you sustain me.

And a couple of other things while I’m thinking about it:
